        "- This is a Jupyter notebook for running Multiple ligand Docking using AutoDock vina software. I am encourage you to watch the tutorial before using this pipeline.\n",
        "- The main goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to perform molecular docking using an open source software in a cheap and yet feasible fashion ðŸš€.\n",

        "**Introduction**\n",
        "- AutoDock Vina is a widely used open-source docking engine known for its speed and efficiency. Developed by Dr. Oleg Trott in the Molecular Graphics Lab, it employs a straightforward scoring function and rapid gradient-based conformational search. The Forli Lab at The Scripps Research Institute currently maintains and develops this powerful tool.\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Importance of Molecular Docking**\n",
        "- Molecular docking is crucial in drug discovery, allowing researchers to predict how small molecules, such as drugs, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure. It helps in identifying potential drug candidates by screening large libraries of compounds.\n",
        "- It provides insights into the binding interactions between ligands and proteins. This understanding is essential for designing more effective drugs with higher affinity and specificity.\n",
        "- By simulating the docking process, molecular docking reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming experimental procedures in the initial stages of drug development.\n",
        "- Docking helps predict the binding affinity of ligands to their target proteins, which is important for evaluating the potential efficacy of drug candidates.\n",
        "- It enables the virtual screening of large compound libraries, accelerating the identification of promising lead compounds.\n",
        "- Molecular docking can be used to optimize the structure of lead compounds by predicting how structural changes will affect binding affinity and specificity.\n",
