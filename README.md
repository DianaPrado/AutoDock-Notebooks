## Hello there!
This is a repository where you can find Jupyter Notebook scripts for running Molecular Docking using Google Colab. This repository is created by ([**Mostafa S. Abd El-Maksoud**](https://github.com/mabdelmaksoud53)) and I encourage you to read the instructions and watch the tutorials before using this pipeline.
The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to perform molecular docking using open-source software in a cheap yet feasible fashion ðŸš€.

**Introduction**
- Molecular docking is a computational technique that predicts the preferred orientation of a molecule (such as a drug candidate) to a second molecule (such as a protein receptor) when they bind to form a stable complex. This method is extensively used in drug discovery and development to model the interaction between small molecules and their biological targets, providing insights into potential drug compounds' binding affinity and activity.

**Using Molecular Docking on Google Colab**

Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that provides a powerful and flexible environment for running computational tasks, including molecular docking. Leveraging Google Colab for molecular docking offers several advantages:

- Google Colab provides access to free GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly speed up computations without needing expensive hardware.
- Being cloud-based, Colab eliminates the need for local installations and hardware maintenance.
- Users can easily install additional software and dependencies via simple terminal commands in Colab notebooks.
- Multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously, making collaborating on projects and sharing results easy.
- You can store input files and results directly in Google Drive, ensuring easy access and management.
- Sharing data and results with collaborators is straightforward using Google Drive.
- The workflows can be shared and rerun by others, ensuring the reproducibility of the computational experiments.
- Users can leverage Colabâ€™s computational power to run multiple docking simulations in parallel, enhancing throughput and efficiency.
